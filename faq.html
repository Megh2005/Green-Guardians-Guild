    <button class="accordion">What are United Nations SDGs ?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 as a blueprint for a more
            just and sustainable future. These 17 interconnected goals tackle global challenges like poverty, hunger,
            inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation. They recognize that progress in one area is
            linked to progress in others, and achieving these goals requires a collaborative effort from governments,
            businesses, and individuals. By 2030, the SDGs aim to create a world where everyone has access to basic
            necessities, can live with dignity, and the planet thrives for generations to come.

    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            At Green Guardians Guild, we prioritize using eco-friendly materials to craft your sustainable dream
            building. We focus on rapidly renewable resources like bamboo, with its impressive strength and fast growth
            rate. Locally sourced materials like clay and straw, forming the time-tested adobe brick, also play a key
            role. Recycled and salvaged elements breathe new life into a project, reducing environmental impact. We
            don't stop there! We explore innovative options like biocomposites, incorporating natural fibers for
            insulation, and paperless drywall that minimizes deforestation. By carefully selecting these green
            materials, we ensure your building boasts a lower carbon footprint and contributes to a healthier planet.

    <button class="accordion">How IOCL is Promoting Sustainable Green Construction ?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), a leading energy provider in India, is actively promoting green and
            sustainable development through various initiatives. They're investing in renewable energy sources like wind
            and solar power, reducing greenhouse gas emissions in their operations, and developing biofuels. IOCL is
            also working towards cleaner transportation by promoting electric vehicles and collaborating with
            stakeholders to create a robust charging infrastructure. Additionally, they're implementing energy
            efficiency measures across their refineries and depots, and promoting afforestation programs to offset
            carbon emissions. Through these efforts, IOCL is striving to balance its core business activities with
            environmental responsibility.

    <button class="accordion">How India Will Achieve Green Construction Goals ?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            India's green construction goals hinge on a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, strengthening existing
            frameworks like the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) and promoting established rating systems like
            GRIHA will ensure baseline sustainability. Public-private partnerships are crucial for financing green
            projects. Banks offering loan incentives for green buildings and issuing green bonds can bridge the initial
            cost gap. Additionally, fostering innovation in eco-friendly materials and construction techniques will
            bring down costs in the long run. Finally, raising public awareness about the long-term benefits of green
            buildings are lower energy bills and a healthier environment which will drive demand and propel India towards a
            sustainable future.
